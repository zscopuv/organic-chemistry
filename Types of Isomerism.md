# Types of Isomerism
- isomerism is the phenomenon where different chemical compounds have the same molecular formulae but different arrangements of atoms (different physical sometimes chemical properties)

## Classification of Isomers
### Constitutional (structural)
- different sequence of atoms
- different structure formulas
---
- **Chain Isomerism**:
    - keep double bonds
    - break the straight structure into branched
- **Position Isomerism**:
    - change the position of double bonds
- **Functional Group Isomerism** (*ethers â†’ alcohols*)
    - change prefix (**cyclo-**)
    - change suffix (**-ane**, **-ene**, **-yne**)

## Stereoisomerism
- same sequence of atoms
- same structure formulas
---
- **Geometric Isomerism**:
    - **cis-** - same side
    - **trans-** - across the double bond
- **Optical Isomerism**
    - enantiomers
