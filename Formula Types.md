# Types of Organic Formulas

### Molecular Formula **C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>**
- it shows the number of each type of atom present

### Empirical Formula **C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O**
- it gives the simplest whole number ratio of the different types of atoms

### Condensed Formula **CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH**
- each Carbon atom is written separately, with atoms attached to it

### Displayed Formula
- all the atoms and all the bonds are written and the bonds are represented as lines

### Structural Formula
- each Carbon atom is written separately, with atoms attached to it
- the carbon bonds are represented as lines

### Skeletal Formula
- hydrogens are omitted, and the line ends represent carbon
